Music has adapted to successive forms of media disseminationfrom phonograph cylinders to MP3seach subjected to the political and economic forces of its particular era and region. Carried by mass media, the broader culture of Arab music has been thoroughly transformed as well. Simultaneously, mass mediated music has become a powerful social force. While parallel processes have unfolded worldwide, their implications in the Arabic-speaking world have thus far received little scholarly attention. This provocative volume features sixteen new essays examining these issues, especially televised music and the controversial new genre of the music video. Perceptive voicesboth emerging and establishedrepresent a wide variety of academic disciplines. Incisive essays by Egyptian critics display the textures of public Arabic discourse to an English readership. Authors address the key issues of contemporary Arab societygender and sexuality, Islam, class, economy, power, and nationas refracted through the culture of mediated music. Interconnected by a web of recurrent concepts, this collection transcends music to become an important resource for the study of contemporary Arab society and culture.

Inspired by the Cervantes classic, Sam DuChamp, mediocre writer of spy thrillers, creates Quichotte, a courtly, addled salesman obsessed with television, who falls in impossible love with the TV star Salman R. Together with his (imaginary) son Sancho, Quichotte sets off on a picaresque quest across America to prove worthy of her hand, gallantly braving the tragicomic perils of an age where 'Anything-Can-Happen'. Meanwhile his creator, in a midlife crisis, has equally urgent challenges of his own. Just as Cervantes wrote Don Quixote to satirise the culture of his time, Rushdie takes the reader on a wild ride through a country on the verge of moral and spiritual collapse, with the kind of storytelling magic that is the hallmark of his work. The fully realised lives of DuChamp and Quichotte intertwine in a profoundly human quest for love and a wickedly entertaining portrait of an age in which fact is so often indiscernible from fiction. **A DAILY TELEGRAPH BOOK OF THE YEAR**","details":null,"author_id":34,"language_id":1,"age_id":1},{"title":"The Hunting Party","slug":"The-Hunting-Party","thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=3VQCtAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=3VQCtAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn":"9780008297114","description":"*The Sunday Times Top 5 bestseller* EVERYONE'S INVITED.

Lauren Groff Words are important to Gretel, always have been. As a child, she lived on a canal boat with her mother, and together they invented a language that was just their own. She hasn't seen her mother since the age of sixteen, though - almost a lifetime ago - and those memories have faded. Now Gretel works as a lexicographer, updating dictionary entries, which suits her solitary nature. A phone call from the hospital interrupts Gretel's isolation and throws up questions from long ago. She begins to remember the private vocabulary of her childhood. She remembers other things, too: the wild years spent on the river; the strange, lonely boy who came to stay on the boat one winter; and the creature in the water - a canal thief? - swimming upstream, getting ever closer. In the end there will be nothing for Gretel to do but go back. Daisy Johnson's debut novel turns classical myth on its head and takes readers to a modern-day England unfamiliar to most. As daring as it is moving, Everything Under is a story of family and identity, of fate, language, love and belonging that leaves you unsettled and unstrung.","details":null,"author_id":36,"language_id":1,"age_id":1},{"title":"Blink","slug":"Blink","thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=z7G13xBtfkQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=z7G13xBtfkQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn":"9780141014593","description":"Intuition is not some magical property that arises unbidden from the depths of our mind.

If it were 1995, it would be \"Why Amazon Is Going to Take Over the Retailing World\" . . . The Thank You Economy is about something big, something greater than any single revolutionary platform. It isn't some abstract concept or wacky business strategy\u2014it's real, and every one of us is doing business in it every day, whether we choose to recognize it or not. It's the way we communicate, the way we buy and sell, the way businesses and consumers interact online and offline. The Internet, where the Thank You Economy was born, has given consumers back their voice, and the tremendous power of their opinions via social media means that companies and brands have to compete on a whole different level than they used to. Gone are the days when a blizzard of marketing dollars could be used to overwhelm the airwaves, shut out the competition, and grab customer awareness. Now customers' demands for authenticity, originality, creativity, honesty, and good intent have made it necessary for companies and brands to revert to a level of customer service rarely seen since our great-grandparents' day, when business owners often knew their customers personally, and gave them individual attention. Here renowned entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk reveals how companies big and small can scale that kind of personal, one-on-one attention to their entire customer base, no matter how large, using the same social media platforms that carry consumer word of mouth. The Thank You Economy offers compelling, data-driven evidence that we have entered into an entirely new business era, one in which the companies that see the biggest returns won't be the ones that can throw the most money at an advertising campaign, but will be those that can prove they care about their customers more than anyone else. The businesses and brands that harness the word-of-mouth power from social media, those that can shift their culture to be more customer-aware and fan-friendly, will pull away from the pack and profit in today's markets. Filled with Vaynerchuk's irrepressible candor and wit, as well as real-world examples of companies that are profiting by putting Thank You Economy principles into practice, The Thank You Economy reveals how businesses can harness all the changes and challenges inherent in social media and turn them into tremendous opportunities for profit and growth.","details":null,"author_id":40,"language_id":1,"age_id":1},{"title":"Without a Country","slug":"Without-a-Country","thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=ZxGrswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=ZxGrswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn":"9781503900974","description":"From the international bestselling author of Last Train to Istanbul comes a novel based on true events that explores the depths of pride, devotion, and persistence as four generations of a family struggle to forge their destinies.

But life elsewhere in Europe offers few opportunities for medical professor Gerhard and his fellow scientists. Then they discover an unexpected haven in Turkey, where universities and hospitals welcome them as valuable assets. But despite embracing their adopted land, personal and political troubles persist. Military coups bring unrest and uncertainty to the country, intermarriage challenges the cultural identity of Gerhard and Elsa's descendants, and anti-Semitism once again threatens their future in the place they call home.

The Commandant at Birkenau, Schwarzhuber, notices her long beautiful hair, and forces her separation from the other women prisoners. Cilka learns quickly that power, even unwillingly given, equals survival. After liberation, Cilka is charged as a collaborator for sleeping with the enemy and sent to a desolate, brutal prison camp in Siberia known as Vorkuta, inside the Arctic Circle. Innocent and imprisoned once again, Cilka faces challenges both new and horribly familiar. When she makes an impression on a female doctor, Cilka is taken under her wing and begins to tend to the ill in the camp, struggling to care for them under unimaginable conditions. Cilka finds endless resources within herself as she confronts death and faces terror, each day a battle for survival. And when she nurses a man called Aleksandr, Cilka finds that despite everything that has happened to her, there is room in her heart for love. Based on what is known of Cilka's time in Auschwitz, and on the experience of women in Siberian prison camps, Cilka's Journey is the breathtaking sequel to The Tattooist of Auschwitz. A powerful testament to the triumph of the human will in adversity, Cilka's Journey will make you weep, but it will also leave you with the remarkable story of one woman's fierce determination to survive, against all odds.","details":null,"author_id":42,"language_id":1,"age_id":1},{"title":"It's the Manager","slug":"It's-the-Manager","thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=UJc1vgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=UJc1vgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn":"9781595622242","description":"Packed with 52 discoveries from Gallup\u2019s largest study on the future of work, It\u2019s the Manager shows leaders how to adapt their organizations to rapid change, ranging from new workplace demands to managing remote employees, a diverse workforce, the rise of artificial intelligence, gig workers, and attracting \u2013 and keeping \u2013 today\u2019s best employees.

There have been exhilarating highs and devastating lows, but his love for the practice of neurosurgery has never wavered. Prompted by his retirement from his full-time job in the NHS, and through his continuing work in Nepal and Ukraine, Henry has been forced to reflect more deeply about what forty years spent handling the human brain has taught him. Moving between encounters with patients in his London hospital, to those he treats in the more extreme circumstances of his work abroad, Henry faces up to the burden of responsibility that can come with trying to reduce human suffering. Unearthing memories of his early days as a medical student, and the experiences that shaped him as a young surgeon, he explores the difficulties of a profession that deals in probabilities rather than certainties, and where the overwhelming urge to prolong life can come at a tragic cost for both patients and for those who love them. In this searing, provocative and deeply personal memoir, the bestselling author of Do No Harm finds new purpose in his own life as he approaches the end of his professional career, and a fresh understanding of what matters to us all in the end.","details":null,"author_id":47,"language_id":1,"age_id":1},{"title":"Washington Black","slug":"Washington-Black","thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=D7aUngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=D7aUngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn":"9781846689598","description":"FROM THE MAN BOOKER AND ORANGE PRIZE SHORTLISTED AUTHOR OF HALF BLOOD BLUES'A masterpiece' Attica Locke'High adventure fraught with cliffhanger twists mark this runaway-slave narrative, which leaps, sails, and soars ... broadens inventive possibilities for the antebellum novel' Kirkus starred review When two English brothers take the helm of a Barbados sugar plantation, Washington Black - an eleven year-old field slave - finds himself selected as personal servant to one of these men. The eccentric Christopher 'Titch' Wilde is a naturalist, explorer, scientist, inventor and abolitionist, whose single-minded pursuit of the perfect aerial machine mystifies all around him. Titch's idealistic plans are soon shattered and Washington finds himself in mortal danger. They escape the island together, but then then Titch disappears and Washington must make his way alone, following the promise of freedom further than he ever dreamed possible. From the blistering cane fields of Barbados to the icy wastes of the Canadian Arctic, from the mud-drowned streets of London to the eerie deserts of Morocco, Washington Black teems with all the strangeness and mystery of life.

What will she do? And what are the implications for her behaviour later in life? Walter Mischel's now iconic 'marshmallow test,' one of the most famous experiments in the history of psychology, proved that the ability to delay gratification is critical to living a successful and fulfilling life: self-control not only predicts higher marks in school, better social and cognitive functioning, and a greater sense of self-worth; it also helps us manage stress, pursue goals more effectively, and cope with painful emotions. But is willpower prewired, or can it be taught? In his groundbreaking new book, Dr. Mischel draws on decades of compelling research and life examples to explore the nature of willpower, identifying the cognitive skills and mental mechanisms that enable it and showing how these can be applied to challenges in everyday life--from weight control to quitting smoking, overcoming heartbreak, making major decisions, and planning for retirement. With profound implications for the choices we make in parenting, education, public policy and self-care, The Marshmallow Test will change the way we think about who we are and what we can be. And since, as Mischel argues, a life with too much self-control can be as unfulfilling as one with too little, this book will also teach you when it's time to ring the bell and enjoy that marshmallow.","details":null,"author_id":71,"language_id":1,"age_id":1},{"title":"The Guest List","slug":"The-Guest-List","thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=S3w4zQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=S3w4zQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn":"9780008297190","description":"","details":null,"author_id":35,"language_id":1,"age_id":1},{"title":"Me Before You","slug":"Me-Before-You","thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=8GNA-OzYFuwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=8GNA-OzYFuwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn":"9780718157838","description":"Lou Clark knows lots of things.

Mark Billingham 'So Hollywood, punchy and cool and pacy as hell.' Eva Dolan Eddie Flynn has 48 hours to save his daughter... Eddie Flynn used to be a con artist. Then he became a lawyer.

Olek Volchek, the infamous head of the Russian mafia in New York, has strapped a bomb to Eddie's back and kidnapped his ten-year-old daughter, Amy. Eddie only has forty-eight hours to defend Volchek in an impossible murder trial - and win - if he wants to save his daughter. Under the scrutiny of the media and the FBI, Eddie must use his razor-sharp wit and every con-artist trick in the book to defend his 'client' and ensure Amy's safety.

Porter\u2019s groundbreaking study of international competitiveness has shaped national policy in countries around the world. It has also transformed thinking and action in states, cities, companies, and even entire regions such as Central America. Based on research in ten leading trading nations, The Competitive Advantage of Nations offers the first theory of competitiveness based on the causes of the productivity with which companies compete. Porter shows how traditional comparative advantages such as natural resources and pools of labor have been superseded as sources of prosperity, and how broad macroeconomic accounts of competitiveness are insufficient. The book introduces Porter\u2019s \u201cdiamond,\u201d a whole new way to understand the competitive position of a nation (or other locations) in global competition that is now an integral part of international business thinking. Porter's concept of \u201cclusters,\u201d or groups of interconnected firms, suppliers, related industries, and institutions that arise in particular locations, has become a new way for companies and governments to think about economies, assess the competitive advantage of locations, and set public policy. Even before publication of the book, Porter\u2019s theory had guided national reassessments in New Zealand and elsewhere. His ideas and personal involvement have shaped strategy in countries as diverse as the Netherlands, Portugal, Taiwan, Costa Rica, and India, and regions such as Massachusetts, California, and the Basque country. Hundreds of cluster initiatives have flourished throughout the world. In an era of intensifying global competition, this pathbreaking book on the new wealth of nations has become the standard by which all future work must be measured.","details":null,"author_id":93,"language_id":1,"age_id":1},{"title":"How to Win Friends and Influence People in the Digital Age","slug":"How-to-Win-Friends-and-Influence-People-in-the-Digital-Age","thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=4AKsuQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=4AKsuQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn":"9780857207289","description":"Since its initial publication, How to Win Friends and Influence People has sold a total of 15 million copies.

But she will learn that life may have more to offer her that she's ever realised, and love might be found in the most unexpected of places.","details":null,"author_id":121,"language_id":1,"age_id":1},{"title":"The Angel","slug":"The-Angel","thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=JyRFvgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=JyRFvgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn":"9780008209131","description":"The Queen of Grip-lit is back...

Having learned that the last person to see her was Constance Holden, a reclusive novelist who withdrew from public life at the peak of her fame, Rose is drawn to the door of Connie's imposing house in search of a confession ... From the million-copy bestselling author of The Miniaturist and The Muse, this is a luminous, powerful and deeply moving novel about secrets and storytelling, motherhood and friendship, and how we lose and find ourselves.PRAISE FOR THE CONFESSION 'Dazzlingly good. The Confession is that rare thing: an utterly engrossing novel which asks big questions without ever once losing sight of the storyteller's need to entertain and move. I turned the final pages in tears and I know already I shall return to it again and again. Without doubt one of the best novels of recent years.' Elizabeth Day, author of The Party and How To Fail'I haven't enjoyed a book so much in a long time . . . I lost myself in the story, not wanting to come up for air. A bold, intelligent, wonderful novel' Sarah Winman, author of Tin Man'Burton is asking important questions in The Confession - questions about motherhood, art and creativity, love, friendship - and in doing this, she has created three utterly fascinating characters. Connie, Elise, and Rose are complicated; complex in ways that women are so rarely allowed to be in literature, demanding that their stories be heard.

From words of comfort to advice for the lovelorn, you can bet that someone, somewhere has come up with phraseology that perfectly sums up whatever situation you find yourself in and put it more succinctly than you could ever dream of.In All That Glisters . Caroline Taggart presents some of the pithiest, wisest and most fascinating quotations we should all know, detailing where the quotation has come from and why it may be useful when searching for an elegant or informed line to illustrate a point, spice up conversation or impress one's friends.Part of the pleasure of this book is to reveal the provenance of the well-worn quote (or misquote) - my cup runneth over, ay, there's the rub, to err is human, the spice of life - but also to introduce some less familiar ones. Most of the quotations included are from classic sources - from the Bible, the works of Shakespeare, other poets, classical authors, Dickens (God bless us everyone, waiting for something to turn up, very humble), Charlotte Bronte (Reader, I married him) and George Bernard Shaw (who didn't actually say Youth is wasted on the young, but may have said something like it. Somewhere. No one seems to know for sure).This entertaining and informed - but not too serious - take on the wit and wisdom of the last 2000 years is ideal for modern readers who like their knowledge in tweet-sized chunks.","details":null,"author_id":143,"language_id":1,"age_id":1},{"title":"Edith's Diary","slug":"Edith's-Diary","thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=hydzngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=hydzngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn":"9780349004556","description":"Edith Howland's diary is her most precious possession, and as she is moving house she is making sure it's safe.

The bloody, devastating civil wars set family against family, friend against friend. At the head of this disintegrating kingdom was Charles I. His rule would change the face of the monarchy for ever. Charles I's reign is one of the most dramatic in history, yet Charles the man remains elusive. Too often he is recalled as weak and stupid, his wife, Henrietta Maria, as spoilt and silly: the cause of his ruin. In this portrait -- informed by newly disclosed manuscripts, including letters between the king and his queen -- Leanda de Lisle uncovers a Charles I who was principled and brave, but also fatally blinkered. He is revealed as a complex man who pays the price for bringing radical change; Henrietta Maria as a warrior queen and political player as impressive as any Tudor. Here too are the cousins who befriended and betrayed them: the peacocking Henry Holland, whose brother engineered the king's fall; and the magnetic 'last Boleyn girl', Lucy Carlisle. This is a tragic story for our times, of populist politicians and religious war, of a new media and the reshaping of nations, in which women vied with men for power. For Charles it ended on the scaffold. Condemned as a traitor and murderer, he was also heralded as a martyr: his reign destined to sow the seeds of democracy across Britain and the New World.","details":null,"author_id":145,"language_id":1,"age_id":1},{"title":"I Made a Mistake","slug":"I-Made-a-Mistake","thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=PETTxgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=PETTxgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn":"9780241984659","description":"IT STARTED WITH A KISS...

Published to coincide with this 'remarkable achievement' and in the anniversary year, Dear Mr Murray is a collection of some of the best letters from the hundreds of thousands held in the John Murray Archive. They reveal not only the story of some of the most interesting and influential books in history but also the remarkable friendships - as well as occasional animosities - between author and publisher, as well as readers, editors, printers and illustrators. Despite the incredible number of letters that were retained by the Murray family, some failed to arrive, others were delayed and some barely survived, but longevity added to the reputation and fame of John Murray and a correspondent in Canada who addressed his letter merely to 'John Murray, The World-wide famous Book & Publishing House, London, England' as early as 1932 could be confident that his letter would arrive. Intended to entertain and inspire, and spanning more than two hundred years, Dear Mr Murray is full of literary history and curiosities: from Charles Darwin's response to the negative reviews of On the Origin of Species to Adrian Conan Doyle challenging Harold Nicolson to a duel for insulting his father in the press; from David Livingstone's displeasure at the proposed drawing of a lion to represent his near-death encounter in Missionary Travels to William Makepeace Thackeray apologising for his drunken behaviour; from Byron berating John Murray for being fooled by his girlfriend's forgery of his signature to the poet James Hogg so desperate for money that he claims he won't be able to afford a Christmas goose; and from Jane Austen expressing concern about printing delays to Patrick Leigh Fermor beseeching Jock Murray not to visit him until he'd completed A Time of Gifts. Complemented by illustrations and reproductions of letters and envelopes, this is the perfect gift for book lovers everywhere.","details":null,"author_id":159,"language_id":2,"age_id":1},{"title":"Beautiful Bad","slug":"Beautiful-Bad","thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=Oj-EtQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=Oj-EtQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn":"9781787472761","description":"'Ward writes with the same compelling energy as you get in a blockbuster Netflix series' Daily Mail 'Compelling.

Over the coming months, her bravery helped her sister to survive and led to her bunkmates rescuing her during a death march. When their camp was finally liberated, Edith was pulled from a pile of bodies, barely alive. In The Choice, Edith Eger shares her life, remarkable because her years in the concentration camp encouraged her to find a hope and resilience that most of us would never think was possible. It wasn't easy but, as she tried to find a future for herself after the Second World War, partly by helping many others through their own versions of trauma, she discovered an honesty, strength and empowerment within herself that makes for a memorable and inspiring read.

In Covey's experience, the thing that most undermines the ability to execute goals is what he calls the Whirlwind: those urgent tasks that must be done simply to keep an organization alive. As Covey shows, the only way to execute new, important goals is to separate those goals from the Whirlwind. The Four Disciplines allow leaders to create a strategy that requires a change in behaviour, since only by ensuring that everyone on the team understands the goal, knows what to do to reach it and knows whether progress is being made, will a leader produce consistent breakthrough results while sustaining the urgent work of the Whirlwind. The Four Disciplines of Execution are:1. Focus on the Wildly Important; 2. Act on the Lead Measures; 3. Keep a Compelling Scoreboard; 4. Create a Cadence of Accountability. For more than a decade FranklinCovey has been studying what it takes to achieve important goals, and in this book they share success stories from a wide range of companies that have implemented the Four Disciplines to result in greater profits, increased market share and improved customer satisfaction.

Feist. The world of Garn once boasted five great kingdoms, until the King of Ithrace was defeated and every member of his family executed by Lodavico, the ruthless King of Sandura, a man with ambitions to rule the world. Ithrace's ruling family were the legendary Firemanes, and represented a great danger to the other kings. Now four great kingdoms remain, on the brink of war. But rumour has it that the newborn son of the last king of Ithrace survived, carried off during battle and sequestered by the Quelli Nacosti, a secret society whose members are trained to infiltrate and spy upon the rich and powerful throughout Garn. Terrified that this may be true, and that the child will grow to maturity with bloody revenge in his heart, the four kings have placed a huge bounty on the child's head. In the small village of Oncon, Declan is apprenticed to a master blacksmith, learning the secrets of producing the mythical king's steel. Oncon is situated in the Covenant, a neutral region lying between two warring kingdoms. Since the Covenant was declared, the region has existed in peace, until violence explodes as slavers descend upon the village to capture young men to press as soldiers for Sandura. Declan must escape, to take his priceless knowledge to Baron Daylon Dumarch, ruler of Marquensas, perhaps the only man who can defeat Lodavico of Sandura, who has now allied himself with the fanatical Church of the One, which is marching across the continent, imposing its extreme form of religion upon the population and burning unbelievers as they go. Meanwhile, on the island of Coaltachin, the secret domain of the Quelli Nacosti, three friends are being schooled in the deadly arts of espionage and assassination: Donte, son of one of the most powerful masters of the order; Hava, a serious girl with fighting abilities that can set any opponent on their back; and Hatu, a strange, conflicted lad in whom fury and calm war constantly, whose hair is a bright and fiery shade of red...","details":null,"author_id":175,"language_id":2,"age_id":1},{"title":"Linger","slug":"Linger","thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=VUcgnwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=VUcgnwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn":"9781407145778","description":"The #1 bestselling SHIVER, LINGER and FOREVER trilogy rejacketed for a new generation of fans.

A group of old university friends leave the bright lights of London and travel to Unst, Shetland's most northerly island, to celebrate the marriage of one of their friends to a Shetlander. But late on the night of the wedding party, one of them, Eleanor, disappears - apparently into thin air. It's mid-summer, a time of light nights and unexpected mists. The following day, Eleanor's friend Polly receives an email. It appears to be a suicide note, saying she'll never be found alive. And then Eleanor's body is discovered, lying in a small loch close to the cliff edge. Detectives Jimmy Perez and Willow Reeves are dispatched to Unst to investigate. Before she went missing, Eleanor claimed to have seen the ghost of a local child who drowned in the 1920s. Her interest in the ghost had seemed unhealthy - obsessive, even - to her friends: an indication of a troubled mind. But Jimmy and Willow are convinced that there is more to Eleanor's death than they first thought. Is there a secret that lies behind the myth? One so shocking that someone would kill - many years later - to protect?

In Unfu*k Yourself, Gary John Bishop told us it was time to stop making excuses- to recognize and take responsibility for the negative self-talk holding us back. In Stop Doing That Sh*t, he builds on that message, teaching us how to stop self-sabotaging behavior. Bishop explains how our destructive cycles come down to the way that we're wired. He then identifies different types of people and the ways we fu*k ourselves over: We can't save money. We land in the same type of toxic relationship. We're stuck in a rut at work. Analysing why we act the way we do, including what our common grenades are that blow up our lives, Bishop then shows how we can interrupt the cycle and stop self-sabotaging our lives. Written in the same in your face style as Unfu*k Yourself, Stop Doing that Sh*t will help us get in touch with our psychological machinery so we learn to interrupt negative thoughts and behaviour before they start, allowing us to give our attention to something else, and start to find success in the areas we thought we never could. We can take back our lives. We may have fu*ked up in the past, but Stop Doing That Sh*t will show us how to break the patterns in order to live the lives we yearn to have.","details":null,"author_id":191,"language_id":2,"age_id":1},{"title":"FURIES.","slug":"FURIES.","thumbnail":"","image":"","isbn":"9780008288983","description":"","details":null,"author_id":192,"language_id":2,"age_id":1},{"title":"A Little Princess","slug":"A-Little-Princess","thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=rrBMMQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=rrBMMQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn":"9781407172699","description":"Sent to an English boarding school from her home in India, privileged Sara Crewe becomes a show pupil - a \"little princess\" with luxuries bestowed upon her because of her father's wealth.

People may know of Sackville West's novels, or her passion for gardening, or her relationship with Virginia Woolf, but few know of her efforts to boost the morale of her beloved England during World War II. Sackville-West spent her childhood years at Knole House, a stately country home that deeply influenced her life and work. In entertaining and accessible prose she brings a deep affection to the task of boosting the morale of a country beset by war. This volume in the Britain in Pictures series is a love letter to the elegant homes of the English countryside and served as a balm to a besieged country. Writing at the height of the Blitz, as cities lay in smoldering ruins after relentless bombing, Sackville-West demonstrates a yearning for the safety provided by these exceptional buildings. We discover the architecture of the stately houses, with details conveyed in such entertaining and vivid prose that the buildings and surrounding areas come to life. The story is not just about the buildings, however, but also about the people who built and lived in them, from the most common of squires to the highest-born kings and queens. Equal parts architectural history and cultural history, this insider's view is quintessentially British. Its elegant package, with a ribbon for bookmarking, makes it the perfect gift for any Anglophile.","details":null,"author_id":196,"language_id":2,"age_id":1},{"title":"I Know My Name","slug":"I-Know-My-Name","thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=uYRwvgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=uYRwvgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn":"9780008237530","description":"...But what if that's the only thing you can remember?

Tessa is no longer the sweet, simple, good girl she was when she met Hardin--any more than he is the cruel, moody boy she fell so hard for. Tessa understands all the troubling emotions brewing within Hardin, and she knows she's the only one who can calm him when he erupts. He needs her. But the more layers of his past that come to light, the darker he grows, and the harder he pushes Tessa--and everyone else in his life--away. After all this time, Tessa's not sure if she really can save him--not without sacrificing herself. Is love worth losing her identity? She refuses to go down without a fight. But who is she really fighting for--Hardin or herself?\"--Page 4 of cover.","details":null,"author_id":101,"language_id":1,"age_id":1},{"title":"Walking Disaster","slug":"Walking-Disaster","thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=unp0MAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","image":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=unp0MAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api","isbn":"9781471115141","description":"Set in the same time-frame as Beautiful Disaster, now we hear the story from Travis' point of view.

ENTER THE WORLD OF STEPHEN FRY'S SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLER, HEROES In this companion to his bestselling Mythos, Stephen Fry gloriously retells the epic myths of the Greek heroes - which will be loved by young and old alike. 'An odyssey through Greek mythology. Brilliant . . . all hail Stephen Fry' Daily Mail ___________ Few mere mortals have ever embarked on such bold and heart-stirring adventures, overcome myriad monstrous perils, or outwitted scheming vengeful gods, quite as stylishly and triumphantly as Greek heroes. In this companion to his bestselling Mythos, Stephen Fry brilliantly retells these dramatic, funny, tragic and timeless tales. Join Jason aboard the Argo as he quests for the Golden Fleece. See Atalanta - who was raised by bears - outrun any man before being tricked with golden apples. Witness wily Oedipus solve the riddle of the Sphinx and discover how Bellerophon captures the winged horse Pegasus to help him slay the monster Chimera. Filled with white-knuckle chases and battles, impossible puzzles and riddles, acts of base cowardice and real bravery, not to mention murders and selfless sacrifices, Heroes is the story of what we mortals are truly capable of - at our worst and our very best. 'A romp through the lives of ancient Greek gods. Fry is at his story-telling best . . . the gods will be pleased' Times 'Assured and engaging. The pace is lively, the jokes are genuinely funny' Guardian 'An Olympian feat. The gods seem to be smiling on Fry - his myths are definitely a hit' Evening Standard 'Just as delightful and difficult to put down as the first.

Tap into the psychology behind your child's behaviour at every stage of development, and respond with confidence. Find out what your child really means when they say \"Look what I've done!\", \"But, I'm not tired\", or \"You're embarrassing me\" - and discover what's really going on when they can't express themselves at all. Taking more than 100 everyday situations, the book leads you through scenarios step by step, explaining not only your child's behaviour and the psychology behind it but also your own feelings as a parent. It then gives instant recommendations for what you could say and do in response to best resolve the situation.

BILL GATES *#1 Sunday Times bestseller * instant New York Times bestseller * Observer 'best brainy book of the decade' * #1 Wall Street Journal bestseller * Irish Times bestseller * Audio bestseller * Guardian bestseller * FACTFULNESS: the stress-reducing habit of only having opinions for which there are strong supporting facts. Things aren't as bad as we think. Fact. When asked simple questions about global trends - why the world's population is increasing; how many young women go to school; how many of us live in poverty - we systematically get the answers wrong. So wrong that a chimpanzee choosing answers at random will consistently outguess journalists, Nobel laureates, and investment bankers. In Factfulness, legendary statisticians Hans, Anna and Ola Rosling offer a radical new explanation of why this happens, and reveal the ten instincts that distort our perspective. It turns out that the world, for all its imperfections, is in a much better state than we might think. But when we let the bad news take on outsize proportions instead of embracing a worldview based on facts, we can lose our ability to focus on the things that threaten us most.

Maps have influenced humanity in many unexpected ways: life, death, sexual reproduction, espionage, war and peace. How to Draw a Map traces the story of mapmaking - cartography - from the first scratchings on the cave wall to the detailed high-tech 'navigator'. This is the story of human conceptions, often misconceptions, of our world. It is also a very personal story about a mapmaker's journey through life - the exciting new perspectives and the occasional misadventures. Over the last 5,000 years societies and empires have risen and fallen; most, if not all, attempt to record their own visions of our world. In the 15th century, Europeans developed a global reach with their oceanic ships, exploring outward into the world, revealing new possibilities, peoples and opportunities. Mapmakers recorded this journey, revealing to us a window into past triumphs and disasters. The story continues into our own day when diplomats carve up our globe, presenting what we now see as the 'modern' world. In How to Draw a Map, father and son cartographers Alexander and Malcolm Swanston demonstrate the skill, creativity and care involved in the timeless art of creating maps - and what these artefacts reveal about the legion of mapmakers who went before us. y, revealing to us a window into past triumphs and disasters.
